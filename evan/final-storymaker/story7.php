Bob decides to treat Steve with more homework.
<br><br>
Steve accepts the work and starts it, but grows tired from his labors. Eventually, his mind gradually turns to ice cream.
<br><br>
He likes ice cream, as it helps him to calm down from panic attacks, as well as restore his concentration while working.
<br><br>
After he buys ice cream at Baskin Robbins, laze overtakes him, but he tries to push himself to return to work.
<br><br>
Steve, what will you do?
