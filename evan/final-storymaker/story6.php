Bob decides to discipline Steve, unleashing abuela's chancla on the boy.
<br><br>
Steve's soft behind could not bear the holy judgment of the chancla, and he hopped, and flipped, and flopped around in agony while hallucinating about his abuela.
<br><br>
Steve started to hallucinate in Spanish, much to the dismay of his pale complexion and gingery hue. Of course, his classmates were surprised too, fairly certain that Steve had never spoken a second language in his life.
<br><br>
Bob, what will you do?
