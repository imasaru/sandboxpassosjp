Steve decides to turn things up a level.
<br><br>
While Bob is lecturing and writing on the classroom whiteboard, Steve eyes an opportunity to catch Bob. He slowly sneaks upon him, weapon "in" hand, and positions himself at the target. With a hysterical laugh, Steve shouts, <i>kancho!</i> and drives away.
<br><br>

Bob feels the horror of a thousand moons rushing up his rectum. 
<br><br>
<h3><i>Ayahee!!</i></h3>
<br>
Bob takes him a bit of time to recompose himself, but he feels oddly clear afterwards.
<br><br>
Bob, what will you do?
